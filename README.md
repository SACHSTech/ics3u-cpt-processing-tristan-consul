# The Computer Science Teacher



Put your program description here.

The objective of the game will circle around the fact that Mr. Fabroa (The Computer Science Teacher) must help a student who is struggling while coding. (Just Like Us....)
In the first level, Mr. Fabroa has to dodge obstacles, and beat Tier 1 enemies to get to the other side, like the goombas from Super Mario Bros.
The second Level is the same thing, but harder, using both Tier 1 and 2 enemies.
The third Level is the same but with mazes, Tier 1, 2, and 3 enemies.
Boss Fight will include moving obstacles, all of the 3 Tiered enemies. The goal is to survive and kill all of the enemies to eliminate distractions and problems from the student while they are coding. There will be 4 stages. The first stage will involve dodging moving obstacles, and the student's face will look very sad. The second stage will have the student less sad, where you will have to fight Tier 1 enemies and dodge stuff. And so on and so forth. There is also a Tier 4 enemy that you will have to avoid in the fourth stage.

The controls will be the WASD keys for movement. 
Mouse Clicking will activate some of the power-ups, for example: 9000


Enemies: 
Tier 1: Phones, they just walk around. Don't touch them.
Tier 2: Game controllers, walk around and shoot projectiles.
Tier 3: Computer Virus, they can fly and they are faster than the other 2. Do not touch them.
Tier 4: Runtime Errors, exist only in the boss battle. In stage 4 of the boss fight, the student will try to run their code, however, his code will have some runtime errors. The runtime errors will appear on different sides of the screen and you will have 1 second to react in order to avoid them before they start shooting a giant laser beam at you.

Allies:

The main ally that Mr. Fabroa will have is a pufferfish named Aeugh. This ally would always encourage the teacher to help the struggling student

Power-Ups:

Infinity Gauntlet:  This would allow the user to have invincibility for about 5 seconds from any enemies and bosses.

Treadmill: Gives a boost for about 5-10 seconds 

9000: Shoots an energy ball 

Laptop: Heals the character during the level


There will be a sound system with sound effects and songs or tunes that are more affiliated with the meme world. This will help the user with the experience of the overall game.


There will be limitations such as bugging through walls because it either makes the game too easy for the user to play or becomes unplayable due to a bugged wall problem.
